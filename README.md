Lab 4 for @janyljumadinova's Computer Science 383: Multi-Agent and Robotic Systems at Allegheny College. This lab deals with the Rebellion model in Repast Simphony.

A = Active
J = Jailed
Q = Quiet


1. With the government legitimacy high, the population is able to operate in peaceful coexistence.  The result for running the program with its original parameters (.8 legitimacy) causes an increase from 985 Active People, 0 Jailed, and 135 Quiet to 134A, 844J, and 142Q.  When the legitimacy increases to 0.9, all of the 1120 agents are quiet and none of them become active, and thus never rebel during the 150 tick timeframe.  This represents a population that operates peacefully without the presence of cops in a higly legitimate government.  


2. With the original parameter of 0.8 legitimacy an increase from 985 Active People, 0 Jailed, and 135 Quiet to 134A, 844J, and 142Q.  That is an increase of 851A, 844J, and -8Q.  When the legitimacy decreased to 0.7 the numbers went from 984A, 0J, and 136Q to 148A, 843J, and 129Q. That is an increase of 836A, 843J, -7Q.  Compared to the experiment using the original parameter of 0.8 legitimacy: ....  When the legitimacy decreased to 0.6 the numbers went from 951A, 0J, 169Q to 169A, 827J, and 142Q.  That is an increase of 782,827J, -27Q.  Compared to the experiment using the original parameter of 0.8 legitimacy: .... When the legitimacy decreased to 0.5 the numbers went from 930A, 0J, and 190Q to 120A, 839J, and 161Q.  That is an increase of-740A, 839J, -29Q.  Compared to the experiment using the original parameter of 0.8 legitimacy: ....
