Lab 4 for @janyljumadinova's Computer Science 383: Multi-Agent and Robotic Systems at Allegheny College. This lab deals with the Rebellion model in Repast Simphony.


1. With the government legitimacy high, the population is able to operate in peaceful coexistence.  The result for running the program with its original parameters (.8 legitimacy) causes an increase from 985 Active People, 0 Jailed, and 135 Quiet to 134, 844, and 142 respectively.  When the legitimacy increases to 0.9, all of the 1120 agents are quiet and none of them become active, and thus never rebel during the 150 tick timeframe.  This represents a population that operates peacefully without the presence of cops in a higly legitimate government.  
2. In situations of decreasing legitimacy
